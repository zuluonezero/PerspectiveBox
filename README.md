A small disclaimer for those who use it when working on the 250 box challenge:

The 250 box challenge is intended to develop one's internal model of 3D space. It's not uncommon that students will try to use 3D modeling software or something when they struggle, figuring that finding something that will make the task itself easier is a good thing. The problem with this is that it causes them to take a spatial problem and turn it into an observational one, which in turn sidesteps the goal of the task.

So, looking at tools like this in a more general sense to just see how things can rotate and what that does to the lines (frankly this tool's inclusion of the line extensions makes it considerably better than just looking at 3D models), is okay - but you should not be attempting to draw from it directly.
